Hi everyone,

Welcome to Shower Thoughts!

I'll be writing about random thoughts of mine here - it could range anywhere from self reflections or epiphanies to tech related blurbs or tutorials.

Some of my motivations for starting this:
- Use as a playground to experiment with code and designs/logos
- Document problems/solutions for future reference
  - AKA an outlet for my hoarding problem - digital hoarding is slightly better than the physical version right?
- Improve my writing
  - Whether that be techincal writing or writing for an (imaginary) audience
- Force me to organize the thoughts I want to share into something more concrete and coherent
