title: Celebrate your achievements

The gym I've been going to is frequented by some very strong people. They easily rep out my max lifts to start off their warm up. As a result, when I do beat my personal best numbers on a lift, a lot of the joy and sense of accomplishment gets sucked out of me because I start thinking:

`"What am I even celebrating for, they just did 15 reps of my newly record 1 rep PR (personal record)"`

I always have to remind myself that what is challenging for you doesn't neccessarily have to be challenging for others. It's still a challenge for you. And so when you overcome those challenges, you should be proud of what you've done. Celebrate your achievement. Likewise, you shouldn't be putting down others' achievements because they seem insignificant to you - you have no idea how hard it was for them. 

This lesson I've learned from the gym helps me in other domains of my life as well. It's easy to compare your accomplishments in anything you do with someone else, and for most people, there will always be someone out there who outdid you in any measure of your choosing. You shouldn't let that stop you from celebrating what you've accomplished. Continue setting goals and reward yourself for reaching them.
